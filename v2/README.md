# Sample-GPT v2

## Overview

Sample-GPT v2 is a GPT model built from scratch using PyTorch and trained on one of Shakespeare's books. It generates text in the style of William Shakespeare, producing eloquent and poetic passages that mimic his classic writing style.

## Features

* Custom-built GPT model trained from scratch
* Trained exclusively on one of Shakespeare’s books
* Generates text with Shakespeare's vocabulary, tone, and syntax
* Simple interface for text generation

## Installation

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python 3.8+ installed along with the following dependencies:

```bash
pip install torch transformers
```

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dash7ou/Sample-GPT.git
cd Sample-GPT/v2
```

## **Generated Output:**

```
Upon the fields where lovers' dreams take flight,
A whisper'd vow, in night's embrace doth stay,
For fate and fortune weave their own display.
```

## Model Training

The model was built from scratch using PyTorch and trained using one of Shakespeare’s books. It was designed to learn the unique syntax, vocabulary, and style of Shakespeare’s writing without leveraging pre-trained weights.

## Future Improvements

* Train on additional Shakespearean texts for a richer vocabulary
* Improve punctuation and syntax accuracy
* Implement a web interface for easier interaction
